This repository hosts the [[http://ropensci.github.io/plotly-test-table/][ggplotly test table]] in the [[https://github.com/ropensci/plotly-test-table/tree/gh-pages][gh-pages]] branch.

To add a column to the table,

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:ropensci/plotly.git
cd plotly
git checkout $BRANCH_WITH_MOST_COMPLETE_TESTS
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:ropensci/plotly-test-table.git
cd plotly-test-table
git checkout gh-pages
cat SHA1,label >> commits.csv
make
git push origin gh-pages
#+END_SRC

Make sure that the plotly package/repository is in the same directory
as the plotly-test-table repository. For example, I keep both under
=~/R=.

It is OK to change the label in commits.csv! This will just change the
column name in the test table (the PNG files will not have to be
re-made).
