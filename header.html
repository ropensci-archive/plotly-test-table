<body>

  <p>There is a row below for each ggplotly test table that has been
  produced. Each test table is the result of running the plotly tests
  for a particular SHA1 version (in the current ../plotly directory)
  using all the different plotly R code versions listed in
  code_commits.csv/column.labels.
